## Description

NYCMesh is a community-driven, decentralized wireless network initiative based in New York City. It aims to provide affordable and accessible internet connectivity to residents and businesses by creating a mesh network. In a mesh network, individual nodes (routers) connect to each other, forming a web-like structure that can transmit data across the network without relying solely on traditional Internet service providers (ISPs).

This application will provide means for NYCMesh to manage it's wireless sectors that are being used to transport data across city blocks. The main feature of the application is to display a map of NYC that show the different routers NYCMesh manage. The web application will also plot the sector coverage (lobe shaped) of each router to assist NYCMesh in visualizing potential interference and plan for network maintenance/expansions.
