# NYCMesh Node Visualizer
## Description
NYCMesh is a community-driven, decentralized wireless network initiative based in New York City. It aims to provide affordable and accessible internet connectivity to residents and businesses by creating a mesh network. In a mesh network, individual nodes (routers) connect to each other, forming a web-like structure that can transmit data across the network without relying solely on traditional Internet service providers (ISPs).

This application will provide means for NYCMesh to manage the routers. NYCMesh Node visualizer will plot every router with is corresponding sector lobe. The user will be able to rotate the sector lobes 360 degrees. This web application will ensure that the sector lobes of the routers do not intersect with each other.
